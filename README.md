## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For the best experience, your terminal environment should have:

* **A Modern Terminal Emulator**: A terminal that supports truecolor (24-bit color) is recommended for the best visual experience. Examples include Kitty, iTerm2, Alacritty, or Windows Terminal.
* **A Nerd Font**: To ensure emojis and other special characters render correctly, it is highly recommended to use a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).
* **Bun**: You must have the [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime installed to run the application from source.

### Installation & Usage

1.  **Download:**
    Download the latest release executable for your operating system (`terminal-chat-linux`, `terminal-chat-macos`, or `terminal-chat-win.exe`) from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/terminal-chat-client/releases) page on GitHub.

2.  **Run:**
    Open your terminal, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the file, and run it:
